# "Dink" project:

This project is a simple neural network implementation meant for educational purposes, but can also be used in small projects. It uses minimal external repositories (currently only numpy) and is thus easy to get up and running. It is planned to also implement a torch based version which should allow for GPU accelarated computation in the future.

# To get started:

Follow the these steps to get up and running with this mini-libary:
1. Pull this repository to your machine using your version control system.
2. Install the required pakages using `pip install -r requirements.txt` while in the repository.
3. Import `dink` into your project and set up the topology of your neural network.
4. Start training...

# Docoumentation:
Still to be added...
